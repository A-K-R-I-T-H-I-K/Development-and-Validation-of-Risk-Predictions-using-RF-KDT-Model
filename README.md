# Development-and-Validation-of-Risk-Predictions-using-RF-KDT-Model

My goal is to get accurate risk prediction models for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and stroke which are crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. To address this, I used a hybrid machine learning model called RF-KDT that combines decision tree, KNN, and random forest algorithms to predict the probability of these diseases.

By this I compared the performance of the RF-KDT model with individual models and found that the hybrid model significantly outperformed them in terms of accuracy. This suggests that a combination of these algorithms can help better predict disease risk. This also underlines the importance of using medical big data for stroke risk assessment as primary prevention.
